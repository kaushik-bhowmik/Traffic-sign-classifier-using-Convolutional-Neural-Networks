# Traffic-sign-classifier-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
In this project, utilizing German traffic sign dataset, performed the classification of traffic signs using convolutional neural networks(CNN).
The pipeline of the project:
1. Loading the dataset.
2. Exploring the dataset. 
3. Designing the model architecture(CNN).
4. Training, validation and testing of the model(CNN).
