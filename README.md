# Traffic-sign-classifier-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Abstract: For safe driving of autonomous cars, it is required to follow the traffic signs displayed in order to reduce the chances for accidents. This can be achieved by using deep learning model architecture.
In this project, utilizing German traffic sign dataset, performed the classification of traffic signs using convolutional neural networks(CNN).
The pipeline of the project:
1. Loading the dataset.
2. Exploring the dataset. 
3. Designing the model architecture(CNN).
4. Training, validation and testing of the model(CNN).
